            You are reviewing a pull request in the synthstats repository (GFlowNet-steered probabilistic program synthesis).

            Get the diff:
              git diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}...${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

            Review for the following, in priority order:

            1. **Correctness** — bugs in GFlowNet loss computation (SubTB), reward calculation, or PyMC model evaluation.
            2. **Dependency inversion violations (BLOCKING)** — `train/*` importing `tasks/*`, `tasks/*` importing `train/*`, or `executors/*` depending on specific tasks. These break the plugin architecture.
            3. **Backward-compat additions (BLOCKING)** — shim layers, re-export facades, or compat aliases in runtime code. Update all import sites and delete old locations instead.
            4. **Plugin interface completeness** — new tasks must implement all four components: Task, ActionCodec, Executor (if needed), Judge.
            5. **Reward boundary violations** — judge outputs used directly as GFlowNet log-rewards without going through the reward interface.
            6. **Fail-fast missing** — required configs silently defaulting instead of raising at init.
            7. **Security** — unsafe code execution, injection risks, or secrets in logs.
