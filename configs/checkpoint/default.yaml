# Checkpoint configuration for training resumability
#
# Usage:
#   # enable checkpointing to output directory
#   uv run python scripts/train_skyrl.py checkpoint.save_path='${output_dir}/checkpoints'
#
#   # resume from checkpoint
#   uv run python scripts/train_skyrl.py checkpoint.resume_from=/path/to/checkpoint.pt
#
#   # custom interval and retention
#   uv run python scripts/train_skyrl.py checkpoint.save_interval=50 checkpoint.keep_last_n=5

# path to save checkpoints (null = no saving)
# use ${output_dir}/checkpoints to save alongside run outputs
save_path: null

# save checkpoint every N training steps
save_interval: 100

# path to resume training from (null = start fresh)
resume_from: null

# number of checkpoints to keep (older ones are deleted)
# set to null to keep all checkpoints
keep_last_n: 3
